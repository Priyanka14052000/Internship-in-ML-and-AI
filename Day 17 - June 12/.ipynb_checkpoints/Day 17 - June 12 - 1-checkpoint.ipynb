    "* Logistic Regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more  independent variables.\n",
    "* If the output variable or the response variable is discrete(categorical)  in nature, then we use the Logistic Regression\n",
    "* <b>Example</b> : Yes or No, get a disease or not, pass or fail, defective or non-defective \n",
    "* Also called as classification algorithm, because we are classifying the data. It predicts the probability associated with each dependent variable category.\n",
    "* It does not give us the output, it just gives us the probability associated with the output. As it is a classification problem, all the values will lie between 0 and 1.\n",
    "* The  shape of the curve looks like a <b>sigmoid curve</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To predict which class the data belongs to, a threshold can be set. Based upon this threshold obtained estimated prob is classified into classes.\n",
